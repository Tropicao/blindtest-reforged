# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, start by running `npm install` to retrieve mandatory dependencies, then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

:information_source: By default, the project is meant to be run and opened on same host than [the backend](https://github.com/ratchet34/blindtest-reforged-back). If your use case expects your pages to be opened by browsers on different hosts than the one hosting the backend, you need to specify the backend address  when building the front end. To do so, export the `REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_ADDRESS` as en environment variable when building your application. For example : 
```
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_ADDRESS=ws://192.168.1.254:6969 npm start
REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_SERVER_ADDRESS=ws://sunflower.local:6969 npm run build
```



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
