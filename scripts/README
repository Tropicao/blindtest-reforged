# Playlist generator

You can use this script to generate the playlist file used by the
blindtest. It consumes a `songs.txt` describing title and author, and
outputs the corresponding `results.json`. The script acts as a best-effort
youtube search engine, returning the video ID for the first video found
matching the provided song data.

## Usage

- create a `songs.txt` file. Each line must have the following format:
  `<title> - <author(s)>`. You can use the `samples.txt.template` as a base
- run the script. Make sure to have the yt_dlp python module installed
- once the `results.json` file is generated, deploy it in the directory
  exposing the blindtest frontend (eg: the build directory)
